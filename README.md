# perpetual
- Start mpv and setup IPC to communicate
- Perpetual communicates via IPC
- Maitains a perpetual playlist that is sent via IPC to mpv
- Organize incoming TV files (sxanni-style) into Show/ folders (no prompts)
- Maintain an mpv 'recent files' playlist via JSON-IPC (append/prune/reorder)
- Default order = oldest first by mtime
- Exits immediately when mpv quits (press 'q')
- Saves/restores last playing file + position across restarts/quit
- After organizing, per-show S/E retime of mtimes so mtime order matches Season/Episode
- Uses inotify to react to new/updated files
- No periodic polling scan needed
